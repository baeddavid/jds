## Potential Strucutures to be implemented
 * TreeSet
 * 2-3-4 Tree
 * B-Trees
 * LinkedStack
 * LinkedQueue
 * LinkedMap
 * HashTree
 

## Release Data
 * Currently a side project so it will be released in about 4-6  weeks at the current rate. Will be released when the main structures are implemented. This is not a hard release date, as testing and other things may bog me down.
