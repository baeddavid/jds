# JDS (in-development)

JDS(Java Data Structures) is an in development Javascript data structures library. It takes popular Java data structures and implements them in Javascript for convenient use. They come with standard Java methods.

## Data Structures to be implemented
 * LinkedList ✓
 * Stack/Queue ✓
 * Priority Queue
 * Min/Max Heap
 * Binary Search Trees/ B-Trees
 * HashMap
 * HashSet
 * Graph/ Weighted Graph

## Potential Strucutures to be implemented
 * TreeSet
 * 2-3-4 Trees
 * LinkedStack
 * LinkedQueue
 * LinkedMap
 * HashTree

## Release Data
 * Currently a side project so it will be released in about 4-6  weeks at the current rate. Will be released when the main structures are implemented. This is not a hard release date, as testing and other things may bog me down.
